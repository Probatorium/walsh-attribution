"""Figure gate for commit messages.

PROVENANCE. Reused, by reading, from the closed lane whose local checkout is
named `pairing-conditioned`. See `PROVENANCE.md`.

Two rules are enforced, both stated in the opening instructions of this lane:

  R1. No figure appears in a commit message before it has come out of a
      checker. This tool is that checker. A numeral in a commit message must
      resolve to a registry record whose status is verified-here.

  R2. No figure is reused from an earlier report once its object has changed.
      The registry keys a figure by its object, not by its digits. A numeral
      whose registry record is cited-unverified, or which resolves to more
      than one object, is refused. Refusal is the correct outcome: the same
      digits standing for a different thing is the failure mode this rule
      exists to catch.

In this lane the rule bites immediately and on purpose. The figures of the
deposit under audit, and the figures of the auditor's own unregistered
exploration, are the ones most likely to be repeated by reflex. Every one of
them enters the registry as cited-unverified, so none of them can appear in a
commit message of this repository until an artefact here has produced it.

The gate also tells an identifier from a measurement, under three conditions:

  E1. Every exemption carries a stated reason, declared in IDENTIFIERS below.
  E2. Every exemption is counted and printed. No numeral passes silently.
      A run that exempts something says so, says why, and says how many.
  E3. The registry beats the exemption. A token that appears in
      FIGURES.jsonl can never pass as an identifier, however much it looks
      like one. This is what stops a measurement dressing itself as a year.

The registry is FIGURES.jsonl at the repository root, one JSON object per
line, with fields: token, object, status, source, verified_by, utc.

status is one of:
  cited-unverified   the figure is known only from outside this repository
                     and has not been recomputed here. Not usable.
  verified-here      the figure was produced or reproduced inside this
                     repository by the artefact named in verified_by.
  superseded         a cited-unverified record that has since been measured
                     here. It names the exact token and object it retires, so
                     retiring a figure means saying what it was, and the
                     retired record stays in the file. A cited-unverified
                     record blocks its token until such a record retires it,
                     which is how a figure moves from cited to measured
                     without anything being deleted.

Scanning skips trailer lines, that is lines of the form `Word-Word: value`
at the start of a line, and comment lines. Everything else is scanned.

Usage:
    python tools/figures.py check-message PATH
    python tools/figures.py register --token T --object O --status S
                                     --source SRC [--verified-by V]
