"""Run every standing gate of this repository and report a single verdict.

PROVENANCE. Reused, by reading, from the closed lane whose local checkout is
named `pairing-conditioned`. See `PROVENANCE.md`.

Gates, in the order they run:

  1. dash gate      no forbidden dash in any tracked text file
  2. effort log     the hash chain is intact and the session structure is sound
  3. figure gate    the registry parses and every record is well formed
  4. untouchable    contact rule five is not breached in tree, history or config

The figure gate for commit messages runs from the commit-msg hook, not here,
because it needs the message. This runner checks only that the registry it
consults is readable and well formed.

Exit status zero when every gate passes.
