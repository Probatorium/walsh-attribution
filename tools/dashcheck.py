"""Dash gate.

PROVENANCE. This tool is reused, by reading, from the closed lane whose local
checkout is named `pairing-conditioned`. See `PROVENANCE.md`. It is reused
because a gate that has already been attacked by its own test suite is worth
more than a fresh one, and it is recorded rather than presented as new.

Policy, in force from the apparatus commit of this repository:

  U+2014 EM DASH is forbidden everywhere, with no exemption of any kind.
  U+2010, U+2011, U+2012, U+2015 and U+2212 are forbidden everywhere.
  U+2013 EN DASH is forbidden except where explicitly exempted.

The only exemption granted at the opening of this lane is the numeric range
of an APA reference, that is an en dash standing between two digits, and only
inside a file registered in EXEMPT_FILES below. Registration is by path and
is deliberately narrow: adding a file to that list is a visible edit to this
tool and therefore a reviewable act.

Exit status is zero when the tree is clean and one when it is not. Every
offence is printed with its file, line, column and the offending codepoint.

Usage:
    python tools/dashcheck.py                 sweep every tracked text file
    python tools/dashcheck.py PATH [PATH ...] sweep the named files
    python tools/dashcheck.py --history       sweep every blob in every commit
