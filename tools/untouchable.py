"""Untouchable gate.

PROVENANCE. Reused, by reading, from the closed lane whose local checkout is
named `pairing-conditioned`. See `PROVENANCE.md`.

Contact rule five names repositories that this lane does not touch and does
not cite. They are unpublished: no DOI, no deposit, no tag, and third party
verification of that lane is outstanding. A citation to a manuscript a reader
cannot obtain is not a citation, so the rule is not only "do not read" but
also "do not name as a source".

A rule that is only written down is a rule nobody can check. This gate makes
it executable. It fails if:

  1. a remote of this repository points at one of them,
  2. a submodule or an object alternate points at one of them,
  3. one of them is named anywhere in the tracked tree, outside the short
     list of files where declaring the rule requires naming them,
  4. one of them is named anywhere in the history, under the same allowance,
  5. one of them appears in the reference list, which is a citation and is
     refused separately and loudly, because that is the failure this rule
     exists to prevent.

The allowance is deliberately short. Adding a file to it is an edit to this
tool and therefore a reviewable act.

Usage:
    python tools/untouchable.py              tree, history, remotes, config
    python tools/untouchable.py --no-history skip the history scan
